# links by logan

This is a really simple template for anyone to create their own link in bio style page using only HTML and CSS. **You should never use a link in bio website if you know how to create your own.**

You can see this website in action at https://links.bylogan.com.

There are many benefits to creating your own web page for your bio:
* customization
* search engine optimization
* own all the traffic coming in because it goes to your website, not someone else's
* can better fine-tune analytics for your website

In order to use this template you'll need a GitHub account and base knowledge of HTML and CSS. If you don't know HTML and CSS, check out some basic tutorials using Google or YouTube. In my opinion, it's a skill everyone should have a baseline knowledge of.

For this repo to get started.

## Add your info

Here are the following things you should change:
* All SEO info in the `<head>` tag in `index.html`
* The image header
* The header title
* The bio
* All links
* All images
* The favicon
* Social icons and their links
* Newsletter sign ups
* Analytics tracking tag (replace using instructions below or remove if not using analytics)

Otherwise, you'll be stuck with my links.

## Customize your webpage

You can change the colors of the webpage by adjusting the variables in the `:root` tag at the top of `styles.css`. You can also add a background image or change your font there. Really, you an edit whatever you want in this file to customize the styles of the webpage.

You can also change the ordering of the divs that make up the link elements to have your links, section headers, images, socials, and news sign up in whatever order you want. You can also add extra links, etc. as you need. More social icons can be pulled from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

Feel free to make any customizations (or as few) as you want. This is meant to be a starting point for you.

## Add analytics tracking

Check out [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) or [Umami](https://umami.is/).
